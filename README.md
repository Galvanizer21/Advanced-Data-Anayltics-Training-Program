# Advanced Data Analytics Training Program Assignments

This repository contains all of my completed assignments from the Advanced Data Analytics Training Program. The program was an intensive, hands-on course that covered a wide range of data science topics including data preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment, with each assignment in its own folder. Each folder contains all the necessary files to understand and run the assignment, including:

- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) with the code, comments, and analysis.
- Data files (.csv, .txt, .xlsx, etc.) used in the assignments.
- Images or graphs generated from the analysis.

## Tools Used
